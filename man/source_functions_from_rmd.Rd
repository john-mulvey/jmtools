\title{Source functions from an Rmd file}
\usage{
source_functions_from_rmd(path, envir = parent.frame())
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to the .Rmd file}

\item{envir}{Environment in which to evaluate the functions (default: parent.frame())}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the extracted function code as a character vector
}
\description{
Extracts and evaluates only function definitions from an R Markdown file
without executing the entire document. This is useful for reusing functions
defined in analysis notebooks without running all the analysis code.
}
\details{
The function parses R code chunks (delimited by \verb{\\\{r\\\} and }) and extracts
complete function definitions by tracking brace depth. Only lines that are
part of function definitions (identified by \verb{<- function}) are evaluated.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Source all functions from an analysis notebook
source_functions_from_rmd("analysis/01_preprocessing.Rmd")

# Source into a specific environment
my_env <- new.env()
source_functions_from_rmd("analysis/utils.Rmd", envir = my_env)
}
